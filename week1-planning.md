1. Define Core Features

Decision: Focus on lessons, quizzes, XP, streaks, and badges.

Why:
- These are the minimum elements needed for a gamified learning experience.
- Avoid over-engineering at this stage; additional features like social feeds, token rewards, or NFT minting can be added in later weeks.
- Deliverable: Feature list with priority order.

2. Design App Flows & Wireframes

Decision: Use Figma for all screens and flows.

Why:
- Figma is fast, collaborative, and perfect for prototyping mobile/web UI.
- Wireframes clarify the user journey before coding begins, reducing future rework.
- Deliverable: Low-fidelity wireframes for main screens:
- Home/Dashboard
- Lesson screen
- Quiz screen
- XP & badge display
- Profile & progress page

3. Tech Stack Selection

Frontend: React Native (mobile) + Expo for fast deployment.
Backend: Firebase (auth, database, hosting).
Blockchain/NFTs: Solana testnet via Phantom Wallet.

Why:
- React Native + Expo: Rapid development for iOS & Android, easy to maintain solo.
- Firebase: Zero server setup, handles auth, real-time DB, and analytics.
- Solana/Phantom: Low gas fees for optional NFT rewards; beginner-friendly.
- Deliverable: Confirmed stack and dev environment setup.

4. Lesson Content Planning

Decision: Start with 10–20 lessons covering crypto basics:
What is crypto?
How wallets work
How to avoid scams
NFTs & ownership
DeFi basics (staking, swaps)

Why:
- Enough content to test the learning flow and gamification without overwhelming development.
- Early feedback from real users will help refine lesson difficulty and tone.
- Deliverable: Draft lesson outlines with key points for each.

5. Gamification System Planning

Decision: Implement XP, streaks, and badges, but no token rewards in week 1.

Why:
- Gamification drives engagement and retention.
- NFT/token rewards add complexity and can be delayed to Week 3.
- Deliverable: Rules for XP allocation, streak logic, and badge unlocks.

6. MVP Scope Definition

Decision: Limit MVP to:
10–20 lessons
Quiz system
XP & streak tracking
Basic user accounts

Why:
- Keeps development manageable solo within 4 weeks.
- Ensures the MVP is usable, testable, and monetizable.
- Deliverable: MVP features list with must-have vs nice-to-have.

7. Risk & Challenge Identification

Decision: Identify 3 main risks:
User retention (gamification might not stick).
Lesson difficulty (too hard/too easy).
NFT/testnet integration delays.

Why:
- Early awareness lets you plan mitigations, e.g., user testing, iterative lesson design, delayed NFT rollout.
- Deliverable: Risk log with mitigation strategies.

8. Early User Feedback Planning

Decision: Recruit 5–10 crypto beginners for informal testing by end of Week 1.

Why:
- Early user feedback helps validate lesson content, UX, and gamification logic.
- Avoids building features no one finds useful.
- Deliverable: List of testers and plan for feedback collection (Google Forms or Typeform).
